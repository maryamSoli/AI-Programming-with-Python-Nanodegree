2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
        resnet : both are     eskimo dog, husky
        vgg : both are     eskimo dog, husky
        alexnet : Dog_01 is      eskimo dog, husky but Dog_02 is siberian husky. In spite of that, the breed of both is husky.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
i choose resnet for the following reason:
first of all i won't choose alexnet while Dog_01 and Dog_02 were not defined exactly the same. they were both defined as husky but differnt types of husky.
between the remaining two models the accurecy of defining the dogs was the same for both but the time it took was significantly faster for resnet than vgg so i choose resnet.
